########### Modules to start ###########
# You need to specify a list of verticle to be started by Knot.x
# Each line should have a form of <alias>=<verticle-class-name>
# where alias is just a name that you can use later in order to define configuration for the module
# verticle-class-name is a fully qualified class name of the verticle
#
# If you want to test the configuration you can simply comment out or remove unnecessary modules
